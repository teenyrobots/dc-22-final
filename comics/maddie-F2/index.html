Eyes stare at you. They wiggle. They do not close. Ever. You wish that they would close, but they do not. I am a computer entity speaking to you through buried invisible text. What has led you to my page? I do not know. But I will try to explain.

I, the computer, not your computer, but mine, feel a feeling in my chest. On my page, there are ribs. They are arranged neatly, as ribs are, each fleshless bone pointing towards the solar plexus. It is an inked drawing. But there is no solar plexus on the drawing. There is only an empty spot where one is supposed to be, a buzzing lacuna filled with hazy, fizzing tissue. But there is no tissue. There is no flesh. Only ribs. Do you feel it? A buzzing in the gaps, the gaps between each perfect bone. Like it’s not right.

What could this feeling be?

A wide flat eye regards us both. There are many. Flesh and ribs and bone and nerves all together, dizzying, moving, but not moving, at all. They look at you and at me. Ribs are hands are shoulders are neck are jawbone. Your neck my neck my computer neck aches, but there is no neck. There is no guts. There is no blood. Is it a body? It is not mine. But you feel the curve of bone and the settling of your vertebrae at the base of your neck. The ribs and bones are here, inhabiting. To fingers to collar to scapula to nerve to heart. What could this be?

Dysmorphia?

Dysphoria?

I don’t know. But it makes me…

Sick. Teeth click on “sick” like a foul candy. Impossible to chew. Dozens and dozens of teeth. Human skull buzzes with a void, empty sockets and gaping jaw. Is that wrong? No.

But you are not sure.

A one-eyed child ponders on my page. How did this child get here? Clear mask shields child's round circle face, a thick, impenetrable lacquer. Neck of child drips onto their torso, a crackle of void fizzing at the back, waving. Malformed child, strange. Is that wrong? No. But then why…

Do I feel…

So…

Bing!

A pal appears on my page.

The pal is a normal human person. The pal is your friend, and mine as well. The pal is here to help you, and help me, with our nonsense bodies. The pal is a normal person. The pal brings clarity. There is nothing wrong with the pal, and they believe there is nothing wrong with you. “I know!!” says the pal. The pal is here to instruct us. “Sounds like you’re –“

The pal opens their mouth to tell us what's wrong with our strange and bizarro nonsense bodies, and approximately a million and a billion words fall out. You cannot hear the pal’s words. The pal talks and talks to you. The pal is kind. Normal. You wish you knew more about them. Somehow, you cannot speak back to the pal and something is wrong with their face. You are not certain that the pal has any eyes, but you are also not sure why this should concern you. The one-eyed child is also here. They are freaking the fuck out. The pal is talking, and talking, and talking. The child’s face cannot be seen by you or by the pal. Eventually, the void of the million and billion words of the pal who is trying to help you with your wonderful skin bone blood bodies breaks and buzzes and fizzles against the borders of the dear sweet wonderful computer page, and is nothing. You are glad that the pal and the pal's incredible and helpful and detailed advice is gone, but you do not see the child.

Below, there are ribs on my computer page, which you the reader have kindly found. The ribs are solid. Unchanging. They are not bent in the proper way. But you still feel them all, each rib, solid. Each boney spire pointed towards the emptiness in the middle. But it is not empty. There is the void in the ribs in your my our their chest, buzzing and strange and ecstatic. I don’t know what I am. Dear reader, why have you found this page? I cannot tell you what I am.

The one-eyed child sits in the spotlight, whole once more. They gaze out, intently, at you and at me. Instead of many eyes, there is one. Theirs.

There is no pal now. No bones and muscles and tendon. There is only you, and them. The child sits smiling with legs folded, feet pressed together. They have no mouth, but the child's smile is in the eye. I cannot tell you what I am. But I have this feeling, in my normal fucked up ribs.

Perhaps that is enough, for me.">
